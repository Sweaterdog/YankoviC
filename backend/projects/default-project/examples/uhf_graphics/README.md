# UHF Graphics Library Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the UHF graphics library for creating windows, drawing shapes, and handling user input.

## Files

### `bouncing_spatula.yc`
Demonstrates animation with a bouncing rectangle and basic collision detection.

### `calculator.yc`
A graphical calculator implementation showing UI elements like buttons and text display.

### `drive_thru.yc`
Interactive example showing mouse and keyboard input handling.

### `EYKIW_os.yc`
"Everything You Know Is Wrong" operating system simulation - a complex UI demonstration.

### `pokemon_battle.yc`
Game-like interface with graphics, text, and user interaction.

### `spinning_circles.yc`
Animation example showing rotating circular shapes.

### `weasel_stomping_day.yc`
Interactive game demonstrating mouse click detection and dynamic graphics.

## How to run UHF examples:

**How to run:**
```bash
yankovic program.yc
```

## What these examples demonstrate:

- **Window Management:** `start_the_show()`, `cancel_the_show()`, `the_shows_over()`
- **Drawing:** `draw_a_spamsicle()`, `draw_a_big_ol_wheel_of_cheese()`, `print_a_string_at()`
- **Colors:** Using predefined constants like `AL_RED`, `TWINKIE_GOLD`
- **Animation:** Frame loops with `roll_the_camera()` and `that_is_a_wrap()`
- **Input:** Mouse position, clicks, and UI elements
- **UI Elements:** Buttons, checkboxes, sliders

## Why these examples:

The UHF library is the heart of YankoviC's graphical capabilities. These examples show how to create everything from simple animations to complex interactive applications. They demonstrate that despite the humorous naming, YankoviC is capable of serious graphics programming.
