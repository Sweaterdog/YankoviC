# Everything You Know Is Wrong OS (EYKIW OS)

A full-featured, parody desktop environment and operating system simulation for YankoviC, inspired by the best of Windows, Linux, and Weird Al.

## Features
- Dynamic, animated desktop backgrounds
- Advanced window management (drag, snap, minimize, maximize, close)
- Multi-app support: browser, code editor/interpreter, paint, calculator, music visualizer, notepad, file manager, system monitor, and more
- Realistic UI with animations, notifications, and theming
- Built-in YankoviC code interpreter (run .yc files in a window!)
- Fully interactive, working web browser (loads real web pages in a window)
- Fun, musical, and over-the-top visual effects

## Directory Structure
- `EYKIW_os.yc` — Main OS entrypoint and desktop environment
- `apps/` — All built-in applications (browser, editor, paint, etc.)
- `assets/` — Images, icons, and other resources
- `themes/` — Color schemes and UI themes
- `README.md` — This file

## How to run
```bash
yankovic EYKIW_os.yc
```

## Goals
- Rival the look and feel of modern desktops (Cinnamon, Windows 11, KDE Plasma)
- Be the most fun, interactive, and musical OS parody ever made
- Serve as a showcase for YankoviC's graphical and scripting power
