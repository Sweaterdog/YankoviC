### `math_demo.yc`
A simple demonstration of trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`), random number generation (`random_spatula`), and modulus operations (`yoda`).

**How to run:**
```bash
./yankovic math_demo.yc
```

**What it does:**
- Calculates sine and cosine of Ï€/2 radians (90 degrees)
- Generates a random number between 0-99
- Demonstrates the `yoda()` modulus function

**Why this example:**
Shows the basic mathematical operations available in YankoviC beyond the core language operators. The `yoda()` function is particularly important since YankoviC doesn't have a built-in `%` operator for modulus.
